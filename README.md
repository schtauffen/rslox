**John Chabot** ([johnnyboyC](https://github.com/jonnyboyC)) - implementor of [SpaceLox](https://github.com/jonnyboyC/spacelox) which has been immensely helpful. I was excited when some of my code was very similar, and grateful when I got stuck and was able to borrow.  
**Lenard Pratt** ([Lapz](https://github.com/Lapz)) - implementor of [tox](https://github.com/Lapz/tox), a statically typed version of lox. I'm excited to see what his implementation can teach me after I've completed following the book.
